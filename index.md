## About Us

We are a small grassroots student organization seeking to effect lexical change at Swarthmore College. Since our inception in late October 2019, we have sought to convince the College to replace "October" in the college calendar with "Bocktober", in accordance with [an official offer by the Administration](https://www.facebook.com/SwarthmoreCollege/posts/10156241271567132?comment_id=10156241522142132&reply_comment_id=10156242843577132). Though our goal may be humble, we feel it is our solemn Quaker duty to strive to make the world a better place, no matter how small the change may be.

## How You Can Help

As noted above, the College has agreed to make the change if [their Facebook comment](https://www.facebook.com/SwarthmoreCollege/posts/10156241271567132?comment_id=10156241522142132&reply_comment_id=10156242843577132) gets 1864 likes by November 1. Provided you have a Facebook account, all you have to do to Make October Bocktober Again is like the comment. We hope to reach our goal by midnight Eastern Standard Time on October 30, well in advance of the College's deadline.
